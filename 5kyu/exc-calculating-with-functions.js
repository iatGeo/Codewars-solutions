// Calculating with Functions
// This time we want to write calculations using functions and get the results. Let's have a look at some examples:
// seven(times(five())); // must return 35
// four(plus(nine())); // must return 13
// eight(minus(three())); // must return 5
// six(dividedBy(two())); // must return 3
// Requirements:
// There must be a function for each number from 0 ("zero") to 9 ("nine")
// There must be a function for each of the following mathematical operations: plus, minus, times, dividedBy
// Each calculation consist of exactly one operation and two numbers
// The most outer function represents the left operand, the most inner function represents the right operand
// Division should be integer division. For example, this should return 2, not 2.666666...:
// eight(dividedBy(three()))


//My solution
const zero = fn => fn ? fn(0) : 0
const one = fn => fn ? fn(1) : 1
const two = fn => fn ? fn(2) : 2
const three = fn => fn ? fn(3) : 3
const four = fn => fn ? fn(4) : 4
const five = fn => fn ? fn(5) : 5
const six = fn => fn ? fn(6) : 6
const seven = fn => fn ? fn(7) : 7
const eight = fn => fn ? fn(8) : 8
const nine = fn => fn ? fn(9) : 9

const plus = a => b => b + a
const minus = a => b => b - a
const times = a => b => b * a
const dividedBy = a => b => Math.floor(b / a)
