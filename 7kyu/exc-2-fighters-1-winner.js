// Two fighters, one winner.
// Create a function that returns the name of the winner in a fight between two fighters.
// Each fighter takes turns attacking the other and whoever kills the other first is victorious. Death is defined as having health <= 0.
// Each fighter will be a Fighter object/instance. See the Fighter class below in your chosen language.
// Both health and damagePerAttack (damage_per_attack for python) will be integers larger than 0. You can mutate the Fighter objects.
// Your function also receives a third argument, a string, with the name of the fighter that attacks first.


//My solution
function declareWinner(fighter1, fighter2, firstAttacker) {
    while(fighter1.health > 0 && fighter2.health > 0){
      fighter1.health -= fighter2.damagePerAttack
      fighter2.health -= fighter1.damagePerAttack
    }
    if(fighter1.health <= 0 && fighter2.health <= 0){
      return firstAttacker
    }else if(fighter1.health <= 0){
      return fighter2.name
    }else{
      return fighter1.name
    }
