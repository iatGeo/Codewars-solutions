// You're a square!
// Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:
// In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.
// The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.


//My solution
var isSquare = function(n){
    return Math.sqrt(n)%1===0 ? true : false
}
