// Merge two sorted arrays into one
// You are given two sorted arrays that both only contain integers. Your task is to find a way to merge them into a single one, sorted in asc order. Complete the function mergeArrays(arr1, arr2), where arr1 and arr2 are the original sorted arrays.
// You don't need to worry about validation, since arr1 and arr2 must be arrays with 0 or more Integers. If both arr1 and arr2 are empty, then just return an empty array.
// Note: arr1 and arr2 may be sorted in different orders. Also arr1 and arr2 may have same integers. Remove duplicated in the returned result.


//My solution
function mergeArrays(arr1, arr2) {
    if(arr1.length==0 && arr2.length==0) return []
  
    return Array.from( new Set([...arr1, ...arr2])).sort( (a,b) => a-b)
}
