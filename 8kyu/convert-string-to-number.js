// Convert a String to a Number!
// We need a function that can transform a string into a number. What ways of achieving this do you know?
// Note: Don't worry, all inputs will be strings, and every string is a perfectly valid representation of an integral number.


//My solution
const stringToNumber = str => Number(str)
